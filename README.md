### Researchers at GSK have been working on an innovative family of drugs to help people with 
solid tumours that continue to grow despite other treatments. A promising candidate, 
Miraculon-B (a fake name, obviously!), has been making its way through our development 
pipeline.
A late phase clinical trial for Miraculon-B has recently finished. This trial was focused on 
understanding if Miraculon-B was more effective than the standard of care in shrinking solid 
tumours in patients that donâ€™t respond to other treatments. To determine this, the clinical trial 
data needed to be analysed to understand whether patients saw enough of a benefit from 
the treatment. Work is underway to present a package to the regulatory agencies that 
describes who is most likely to benefit from this new medicine and to seek agreement on our 
proposed strategy for aiding prescribers considering the value of Miraculon-B for their 
patients.
